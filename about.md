Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a software developer originally from Chicago, Illinois.

I like designing and developing products, usually for iOS devices, but sometimes for the web.

I'm interested in functional programming, app architecture, and UI and UX design.

I'm currently working on a few personal projects while I see some of the world.

Previously, I worked at [Timehop](http://timehop.com) and [Klein Tools](http://kleintools.com). I also worked on my own iOS apps [Vinylogue](http://twocentstudios.com/apps/vinylogue) and [BrightBus](http://twocentstudios.com/apps/brightbuscu).

You can contact me via [email](mailto:chris@twocentstudios.com) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/twocentstudios). Check out my open source projects on [github](http://github.com/twocentstudios). I wouldn't bother with [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-trott/19/b64/1b2).
